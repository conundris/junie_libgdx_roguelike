# Network Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement network functionality for the Vampire Survivors clone game. The implementation will allow players to choose at startup whether they want to host a game or join someone else's game.

## Requirements
- Add a startup screen for network mode selection
- Implement host functionality
- Implement client functionality
- Synchronize game state between host and client
- Ensure smooth gameplay experience in networked mode

## Implementation Steps
1. Explore the existing codebase to understand the current structure
   - Examine Main.kt to understand the game initialization
   - Check existing network code in the network directory
   - Understand the screen management system

2. Design the network implementation
   - Create/modify network classes for host and client functionality
   - Implement data synchronization between host and client
   - Define network protocol and message types

3. Create a startup screen for network selection
   - Add UI for choosing between host, client, or single player
   - Implement navigation to the appropriate game mode
   - Add input fields for IP address/port when joining a game

4. Connect the network selection to the game initialization
   - Modify the game initialization process to support networked play
   - Initialize the appropriate network components based on user selection

5. Test the network functionality
   - Test host creation
   - Test client connection
   - Test game state synchronization
   - Test error handling and edge cases

6. Document the changes
   - Update code documentation
   - Create a summary of the network implementation

## Technical Approach
- Use LibGDX's networking capabilities or a third-party networking library
- Implement a client-server architecture where one player acts as the host
- Use serialization for network messages
- Implement state synchronization to keep game consistent between players
