# Network Implementation Tasks

## Exploration Tasks
1. [x] Examine Main.kt to understand game initialization flow
2. [x] Explore existing network directory to check for any network-related code
3. [x] Understand the screen management system and how to add a new startup screen
4. [x] Identify the appropriate LibGDX networking capabilities or third-party libraries to use

## Network Implementation Tasks
5. [x] Create/update NetworkManager class to handle network connections
   - Found existing NetworkManager implementation
6. [x] Implement host functionality:
   - [x] Create server socket and accept connections
   - [x] Broadcast game state to clients
   - [x] Process client inputs
7. [x] Implement client functionality:
   - [x] Connect to host server
   - [x] Send player inputs to host
   - [x] Receive and apply game state updates
8. [x] Define network protocol and message types:
   - [x] Create serializable message classes
   - [x] Implement serialization/deserialization
   - [x] Define message handling logic

## UI Implementation Tasks
9. [x] Create a NetworkSelectionScreen class
   - Found existing NetworkScreen implementation
10. [x] Design UI for network mode selection:
    - [x] Add buttons for "Host Game", "Join Game", and "Play Solo"
    - [x] Add input fields for IP address and port when joining a game
    - [x] Add back button to return to main menu
11. [x] Implement navigation between screens:
    - [x] Connect NetworkSelectionScreen to the main game flow
    - [x] Handle transitions between screens

## Integration Tasks
12. [x] Modify Main.kt to include the network selection at startup
13. [x] Update GameScreen to handle networked gameplay:
    - [x] Differentiate between host and client behavior
    - [x] Synchronize game state between players
14. [x] Implement error handling for network operations:
    - [x] Handle connection failures
    - [x] Handle disconnections during gameplay
    - [x] Provide user feedback for network issues

## Testing Tasks
15. [x] Test host game creation
16. [x] Test client connection to host
17. [x] Test game state synchronization
18. [x] Test error handling and edge cases
19. [x] Test performance under different network conditions

## Documentation Tasks
20. [x] Update code documentation with network-related comments
21. [x] Create a summary document of the network implementation
22. [x] Update README.md with network functionality information
