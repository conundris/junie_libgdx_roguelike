# Networking Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation
1. [ ] Add KryoNet (or similar) networking library to build.gradle.kts
2. [ ] Create basic network message classes structure
   - [ ] Create NetworkMessage base class
   - [ ] Create ConnectionMessage class
   - [ ] Create PlayerStateMessage class
   - [ ] Create EnemyStateMessage class
   - [ ] Create GameStateMessage class
   - [ ] Create InputMessage class
   - [ ] Create SpawnMessage class
   - [ ] Create DamageMessage class
   - [ ] Create ExperienceMessage class
3. [ ] Create NetworkSerializer class for message serialization/deserialization
4. [ ] Create NetworkManager class to handle all network operations
5. [ ] Create GameServer class for server-side logic
6. [ ] Create GameClient class for client-side communication

## Phase 2: Core Network Infrastructure
7. [ ] Implement connection handling in NetworkManager
8. [ ] Implement client discovery mechanism (for LAN play)
9. [ ] Implement server hosting functionality
10. [ ] Implement client connection to server
11. [ ] Add network entity ID system for game objects
12. [ ] Implement basic message sending/receiving between client and server
13. [ ] Add error handling and connection status monitoring

## Phase 3: Game State Synchronization
14. [ ] Modify Player class to support network synchronization
    - [ ] Add network ID field
    - [ ] Add serialization methods
    - [ ] Implement state update methods
15. [ ] Modify Enemy class to support network synchronization
    - [ ] Add network ID field
    - [ ] Add serialization methods
    - [ ] Implement state update methods
16. [ ] Implement server-side game state management
    - [ ] Track connected players
    - [ ] Manage enemy spawning and synchronization
    - [ ] Handle player inputs and update game state
17. [ ] Implement client-side prediction and reconciliation
18. [ ] Add delta compression for state updates to reduce bandwidth

## Phase 4: Multiplayer UI and Experience
19. [ ] Create network connection screen/UI
20. [ ] Implement lobby system for waiting for players
21. [ ] Add visual indicators for other players in game
22. [ ] Implement player joining/leaving handling during gameplay
23. [ ] Add basic chat functionality (optional)
24. [ ] Create host migration capability in case server disconnects

## Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
25. [ ] Test with multiple clients on local network
26. [ ] Implement lag compensation techniques
27. [ ] Optimize network traffic
28. [ ] Add disconnect handling and reconnection logic
29. [ ] Test different network conditions (high latency, packet loss)
30. [ ] Fix any synchronization issues discovered during testing

## Phase 6: Documentation and Finalization
31. [ ] Document networking architecture
32. [ ] Add comments to networking code
33. [ ] Create network troubleshooting guide
34. [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
35. [ ] Commit all changes to the branch
