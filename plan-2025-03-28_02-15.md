# Plan for Reworking Level Up and Upgrades Systems

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach for enhancing the level up and upgrades systems in the Vampire Survivors clone. The goal is to introduce more variety in upgrades, make some upgrades weapon-specific, and ensure upgrades have a more significant impact on gameplay.

## Current Understanding
Before implementing changes, we need to understand the current implementation of:
- The upgrade system (WeaponUpgrade.kt)
- The level up system (Experience.kt)
- How upgrades are presented to the player (GameUI.kt)
- The weapon system (Weapon.kt)
- How the player selects and applies upgrades

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Enhance Upgrade Variety
- Add more types of upgrades beyond the current implementation
- Introduce different categories of upgrades (offensive, defensive, utility)
- Create upgrades with unique effects rather than just stat increases

### 2. Implement Weapon-Specific Upgrades
- Create upgrades that only appear for specific weapons
- Design upgrades that change weapon behavior or add special effects
- Ensure weapon-specific upgrades are clearly indicated to the player

### 3. Make Upgrades More Impactful
- Increase the power level of certain upgrades
- Create upgrades that unlock new abilities or significantly alter gameplay
- Balance upgrades to ensure they feel meaningful without breaking game balance

### 4. UI Improvements
- Update the upgrade selection UI to clearly show weapon-specific upgrades
- Improve the visual presentation of upgrade options
- Add more detailed descriptions of upgrade effects

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze current code to understand existing systems
2. Design new upgrade types and effects
3. Implement weapon-specific upgrade logic
4. Update the upgrade selection and application code
5. Enhance the UI to support the new upgrade system
6. Test the implementation thoroughly
7. Refine based on testing results

## Success Criteria
- Players have more meaningful choices during level up
- Weapon-specific upgrades create interesting synergies
- Upgrades feel more impactful and change gameplay in noticeable ways
