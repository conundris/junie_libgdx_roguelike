# Plan for Implementing Enemy Variety and Boss Enemies

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement more enemy variety and boss enemies with unique mechanics in the Vampire Survivors clone. The boss will spawn after 15 minutes of gameplay.

## Steps

1. **Explore Current Implementation**
   - Examine the current Enemy class structure
   - Understand how enemies are spawned and managed in GameScreen
   - Review the game loop and timing mechanisms

2. **Design Enemy Variety**
   - Create a hierarchy of enemy types with different:
     - Health points
     - Movement speeds
     - Attack patterns
     - Visual appearances
   - Implement at least 3-4 different enemy types

3. **Design Boss Enemy**
   - Create a Boss class extending from Enemy with:
     - Significantly higher health
     - Special attack patterns
     - Unique visual representation
     - Possible phases based on health percentage

4. **Implement Boss Mechanics**
   - Design unique mechanics that require player strategy:
     - Area of effect attacks
     - Summoning minions
     - Charge attacks
     - Projectile patterns

5. **Implement Timer and Boss Spawning**
   - Add a gameplay timer in GameScreen
   - Create logic to spawn the boss after 15 minutes
   - Implement a boss announcement/warning

6. **Testing and Balancing**
   - Test different enemy types for balance
   - Ensure boss difficulty is appropriate
   - Verify timer and spawning mechanism works correctly

7. **UI Updates**
   - Add visual indicators for boss appearance
   - Update any necessary UI elements to reflect new enemy types
   - Add boss health bar

## Implementation Details

- Extend the current Enemy class to create a base class for different enemy types
- Use inheritance or composition to implement varied behaviors
- Implement a timer system in GameScreen to track gameplay time
- Create a boss spawning event after the 15-minute mark
- Ensure proper testing of all new features
