# Networking Implementation Plan for Vampire Survivors Clone

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach for adding multiplayer networking capabilities to the Vampire Survivors clone game. The implementation will enable players to play together in the same game world, synchronizing player positions, enemy states, and game events.

## Networking Architecture

### Client-Server Model
We will implement a client-server architecture where:
- One player acts as the host (server)
- Other players connect as clients
- The server is authoritative for game state
- Clients send inputs and receive state updates

### Network Components
1. **NetworkManager**: Central component managing all network operations
2. **GameServer**: Handles server-side logic, client connections, and state distribution
3. **GameClient**: Handles client-side communication with the server
4. **NetworkSerializer**: Handles serialization/deserialization of game objects for network transmission
5. **NetworkMessage**: Base class for all network messages with derived types for specific messages

### Message Types
1. **ConnectionMessage**: For establishing connections
2. **PlayerStateMessage**: For synchronizing player positions, health, etc.
3. **EnemyStateMessage**: For synchronizing enemy positions, health, etc.
4. **GameStateMessage**: For synchronizing overall game state (time, score, etc.)
5. **InputMessage**: For sending player inputs to the server
6. **SpawnMessage**: For notifying about new entity spawns
7. **DamageMessage**: For synchronizing damage events
8. **ExperienceMessage**: For synchronizing experience and level-ups

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Networking Infrastructure
1. Add networking libraries (KryoNet or similar)
2. Create NetworkManager class
3. Implement basic client and server classes
4. Create message classes and serialization

### Phase 2: Game State Synchronization
1. Modify Player class to support network synchronization
2. Modify Enemy class to support network synchronization
3. Implement game state synchronization
4. Add network ID system for game entities

### Phase 3: Multiplayer UI and Experience
1. Create lobby/connection UI
2. Implement player joining/leaving handling
3. Add visual indicators for other players
4. Implement chat functionality (optional)

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
1. Test with multiple clients
2. Optimize network traffic
3. Implement lag compensation techniques
4. Add disconnect handling and reconnection

## Technical Considerations
- **State Synchronization**: Use a combination of full state updates and delta updates
- **Latency Handling**: Implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation
- **Scalability**: Design for 2-4 players initially, with architecture supporting more if needed
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handle disconnections gracefully with reconnection options

## Dependencies
- KryoNet or similar networking library for Java/Kotlin
- LibGDX's existing components for rendering and game logic

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
